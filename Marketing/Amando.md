### Prime vendor
- how to get fortune 500 companies
    - must go through a prime vendor
    - provide full solution to the client
    - if the prime vendor doesn't have the skillset, they subcontract to an implementing vendor
    - if the implementing vendor doesn't have the skillset, they subcontract to a consulting company (like us)

### Structure of 1st interview
- Resume walkthrough
    - tell me about yourself (30-90 seconds) - done by someone non-technical usually
        - they aren't testing accuracy, they are testing communication skills (presentation), using the right words, and most importantly confidence and trust

    - build trust -> they can always reach out later about a position if trust is built

    - emails -> always wrapping up a project (look busy)
        - 2-3 rounds
        - 1 interaction with vendor
        - 1-2 rounds with end client
            - could be technical or non-technical

        2. Possible Contract to Hire conditions
        3. Visa Status and Sponsorship
        4. Further Rate negotiation - our marketing team already established a rate with the vendor
        5. Prime Vendor scenario precautions
        - multilayer vendors - who is your employer?
            - the previous layer is your employer

### Contracts: C2C vs Full Time vs W2 vs 1099
- can only C2C contracts
    - meaning the contract is signed with their company (not you)
    - Not my own company - I work for a consulting company
    - I decide my own projects
    - if we've worked with them in the past we might be able to do another -> but must be converted back to a C2C contract

- why cant you work on W2 or fulltime?
    - they want to improve their conditions
    - my employer has always provided me access with a wide network of clients and projects for which I am grateful.
      in the future I may be open to other opportunities,
      but for now I am focused on my current path maximizing my experience as a contractor and growth with my current employment
    - give them hope -> but don't move the conversation forward

- why would you like to continue working with your current employer?
    - same as previous question - gratitude, opportunities, growth, etc
    - all projects on our resume are through the current employer -> evidence of opportunities, success, and growth

- are you working through your own corporation?
    - they are asking if you are a 1099 contractor
    - no, I work for a consulting company that provides me with opportunities to work on different projects and clients
    - within the firms framework leveraging their network and resources

- express openness to future opportunities
- always say you are currently on a C2C contract
- marketing team does research on how fast the client is trying to go -> we go in prepared to say how long until our contract ends to start the next project

- some contracts are only contract to hire
    - starts as C2C after some months becomes full time
    - marketing team lets us know that this has been negotiated with the client
    - its only an option, but not a requirement
    - are you willing at some point becoming full time?
        - pokeface - yes at some point in the future
            - earn trust
        - towards end of the project -> negotiate extending contract, but not full time
        - need to win the contract first
    - they could add this kind of question in screening interviews
        - are you fine with the salary range offered when full time opportunity comes
            - is it comparable to your current rate -> yes
            - we can always negotiate after success during contract period - pokerface
    - lets focus on the project and then when the time comes we can discuss it


## Monday with Amando
### Visa Status and Sponsorship
- are you a US citizen or green card holder?
- they want you to be w2 -> how to answer
- why are you working as a consultant?
    - allows me to tackle diverse projects, varied challenges, and continuously expand my skill set
    - my employer provides many benefits (healthcare, 401k, paid time off, etc)
    - I am grateful for the opportunities and growth I've experienced as a contractor
### Further Rate negotiation
- our marketing team has already negotiated a rate with the vendor
- if they ask for a lower rate
    - examples: what rate are you looking for? is the rate flexible?
    - examples: what is your current rate? what is your expected rate?
- I am comfortable with the rate that has been discussed with your team
- Range might have only been set
    - I'm not here to negotiate rates, I am here to discuss how I can contribute to your team and the success of the project
    - The marketing team who understands the market and the value of my skills will handle any rate discussions
    - we can revisit this via email after the interview process if needed

### Prime Vendor scenario precautions
- need to say your employer is the layer you are interviewing with
- TechConsulting -> C2C with ImplementingVendor -> C2C with PrimeVendor -> End Client
- when you are interviewing with the End Client -> your employer is PrimeVendor
- when you are interviewing with the PrimeVendor -> your employer is ImplementingVendor
- when you are interviewing with the ImplementingVendor -> your employer is TechConsulting
- if you mess this up, you could lose trust with any of the middle man layers that could introduce you to future clients
