# Agile Concepts

# Agile Terms
Agile - Iterative approach to delivery value, adapting to change as customers needs evolve.

## Scrum vs Kanban
- Scrum -> uses sprints to deliver work in fixed time intervals (usually 2-4 weeks)
  - need to provide points/estimates for each task on the backlog
- Kanban -> does not use sprints, focuses on continuous delivery instead of fixed time intervals
  - uses pull system to manage work in progress (WIP) limits, boards have limit on how many tasks can be in each column at once, and this signals either team is overloaded or has capacity for more work

## Agile Work Items
- epic is a large body of work cannot be completed in a single sprint or iteration, broken down into smaller user stories or tasks
    - user story is a small feature or capability that needs to be developed, usually from the perspective of the end user
      - format: "As a [USER TYPE], I want [SOME CAPABILITY], so that [A BENEFIT] can be achieved."
- Example:
  - JIRA Project = Shopping App
  - Epic = Shopping Cart Interface
  - User Story = As a customer, I want to checkout items from my shopping cart, so that I can purchase my selected products.
    - Jira contains "Epic" sections to group related user stories together under a larger theme or objective.

# How Jira works
Hierarchical structure of Jira:
TOP: Jira Account Instance (e.g., company or organization)
  - Projects (e.g., specific applications or products)
    - Epics (large bodies of work)
      - User Stories/Issues (specific tasks or features)
        - Issues have 3 main types:
          - Story = represent new functionality or feature from user perspective
              - Sub-task = smaller, more granular pieces of work that break down a story into manageable parts
            - Bug = represent defects or problems that need to be fixed from a previously completed story
            - Task = work required to take an item to "Done"
